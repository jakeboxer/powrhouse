Dear Residents of {{ hhold }},
We'd just like to inform you that {{ hmate.get_full_name }} has left your household. Hopefully, this is because he or she is moving out. If not, please speak with him or her.

If you'd like to add new housemates (or invite ones who already have {{ site.name }} accounts), why not log in to {{ site.name }} ( http://{{ site.domain }}/ ) and do it now?

If you believe {{ hmate.get_full_name }} accidentally left, you should log in to {{ site.name }} and invite him or her back to your household using his or her email address ( {{ hmate.user.email }} ).

Thanks
- The {{ site.name }} Team
