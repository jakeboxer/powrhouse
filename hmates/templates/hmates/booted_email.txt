Dear {{ hmate.get_full_name }},
Unfortunately, you have been booted from {{ hmate.hhold }}. Hopefully, this is because you're moving out. If not, please speak with the rest of your household.

If you're moving into a new household, why not log in to {{ site.name }} ( http://{{ site.domain }}/ ) and create your household on it?

If your new household has already been created, ask one of your new housemates to invite you to it. You'll need to give them your email address ({{ hmate.user.email }}) so they can find you.

Thanks
- The {{ site.name }} Team
